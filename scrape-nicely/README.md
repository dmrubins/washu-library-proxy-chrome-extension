These scripts pull down a copy of journals listed publicly at the Becker and Danforth sites.

They're parsed into:

+ BECKER-UNIQUE.txt
+ DANFORTH-UNIQUE.txt
+ INTERSECT.txt

There's a blacklist of journals that are listed on those sites but /shouldn't/ be redirected.

For example:

+ nih.gov (This is all public)
+ PLoS Journals (These are all open-access Creative Commons)
